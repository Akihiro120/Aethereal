			"description": "You are a human, a being of flesh and blood, with the capacity for greatness and the potential for destruction. You are a blank canvas, waiting to be painted with the colors of your experiences. Your strength lies not in your physical form, but in your ability to adapt, to learn, and to grow. You are a creature of contradictions, capable of both kindness and cruelty, love and hate. You are a reflection of the world around you."
