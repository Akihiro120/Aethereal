    "You are the weaver of wonders, a master of the arcane. The elements bow to your command, and the fabric of reality bends to your will. Fire dances at your fingertips, ice crystrallizes in your breaths, and lightning crackles in your veins. You are a unit of absolute intellegence calculating every spell in a split second. You will become a force of nature. But beware, for the power you wield is as dangerous as it is beautiful.",
